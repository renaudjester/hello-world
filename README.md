# Hi everyone, love you

If you want to see some of the repository I worked on last year here is only couple of examples since the others are private: 
- https://github.com/centralelyon/synchro_temp_start_detection
- https://github.com/centralelyon/dataset_creation

And some older project that we did in the deep learning course of DTU:
- https://github.com/JulesBelveze/text-summarizer
